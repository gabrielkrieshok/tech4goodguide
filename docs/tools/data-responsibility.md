# Data Responsibility

The protection and privacy of people’s information — is one of the key areas where Tech4Good efforts demonstrate their importance in the tech community. It is often the case that maintaining data privacy for users, ensuring their communications are secure and encrypted, and wanting to know what will be done with user data are not the priority of technology companies (who are often in the business of selling user data), and are too complicated and opaque for average users.

## Potential Applications

- Audit existing uses of data to ensure that individual and organizational data privacy & data security are upheld to appropriate standards.
- Practice responsible use of data collection and informed consent in organizations.
- Teach responsible use of digital privacy & security within projects that are leveraging technologies.

## Considerations

If there is one obvious area of mandate and growth for the Tech4Good community, it’s that data privacy & security practices, concerns, and strategies are going to be more important than ever before as the landscape is filled with more sophisticated technologies, more powerful & intrusive companies, and growing worry from the general public on how to deal with it. That said, it is not a simple landscape to navigate. It is often unclear what the rules and standards are for information collected and used by private companies, with whom this information may be shared, and what privacy laws mean for Tech4Good projects.
