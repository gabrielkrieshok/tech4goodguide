# Learning

Learning is a lifelong pursuit — a treadmill of understanding that there are always new skills to learn, new techniques and methods to pick up, and new tools to us. Learning new things, and being open to applying new approaches to old problems, is one of the most critical aspects of being a good Tech4Good practitioner. There might be others who know the subject matter better than you, and others who know how to use the tools better than you — but often there is no one else on stage besides you who knows enough of the tools and enough of the subject matter to make a dent in something that matters.

## Potential Applications

- Upskill a team to bring the latest tools, methods, and skills to the problem.
- Assess the role that a “digital transformation” can play in an organization and be applied to long-standing problems.
- Gain new skills for a career change or pivot.

## Considerations

Learning new things is challenging — and requires time that many of us simply don’t have. It’s a challenge to box out the opportunity cost of learning new techniques, new software platforms, new ways of doing things, and so it’s a challenge to break up large and daunting goals into bite-sized objectives that can be achieved in a timely manner — for you, for your team, for your organization, and for your Tech4Good project.
