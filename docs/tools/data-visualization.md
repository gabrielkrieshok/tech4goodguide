# Data Visualization

Data visualization isn’t a rigidly-defined term — it’s simply using graphic design (and interactivity) to communicate with structured information. This includes posters at academic conferences, dashboards showing how much money is remaining in the budget, or how many health clinics are in a given region.

## Potential Applications

- Design infographics for communications and behavior change campaigns.
- Develop interactive dashboards for insights into operations, performance, and impact.
- Use data visualization to identify patterns in complex or combined datasets.

## Considerations

Communicating well with data can be daunting — it often requires specific skill sets, an in-depth knowledge of the subject-matter, and a dash of creativity. The compelling nature of data visualization examples like dashboards often compels stakeholders to want them, not realizing the time and resources involved in developing them, scaling them, and reproducing them.
