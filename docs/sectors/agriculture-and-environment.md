# Agriculture & Environment

ICTs can support new ways of doing traditional agriculture and environmental work, for example with better monitoring of food systems, access to wider and more diverse markets, better communication and learning platforms, and how to adapt to changing environments and climate change in particular. Specific approaches such as precision agriculture and GIS-enabled technologies can play significant roles in increasing food security, supply chain diversity, and overall productivity.

## Potential Applications

- Using digital services to link small-holder farmers to urban, regional and global markets
- Developing, producing, and broadcasting innovative agricultural practices through radio, video, mobile services, and the Internet for widespread adoption.
- Monitoring food systems, land rights, and farms through precision agriculture using satellite imagery, sensing equipment, Internet of Things devices, and geospatially-linked data.

## Considerations

Agriculture & Environmental areas where ICT can play a role are on a wide spectrum that ranges from individual small-holder farmers all the way to multi-country food security efforts — knowing where to leverage ICTs and at what scale is a significant challenge. Additionally, agriculture & the environment are uniquely tied to local contexts, histories, geographies, etc. so that a solution that works in one way for one group may not always be successfully scaled elsewhere.
