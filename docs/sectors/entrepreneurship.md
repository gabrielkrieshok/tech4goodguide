# Entrepreneurship

In low and middle-income countries, small and medium-sized businesses account for the vast majority of employment. There are many opportunities for pioneering business models to take advantage of new tools and technologies, new approaches, and newly-trained staff and digitally-savvy teams. By focusing on both individual entrepreneurs themselves and connecting them with investment funds, mentorship, and network opportunities while at the same time developing the ecosystem around entrepreneurship more generally (education pipelines, lowering barriers to entry for starting a business, etc.), there is tremendous opportunity to build local talent and sustainable workforce ecosystems.

## Potential Applications

- Help entrepreneurs to access the financing they need to test their business models and grow.
- Develop entrepreneurship ecosystems that are not yet well developed, improving access to networks, market information, business development services, and market infrastructure that are important enablers of growth.

## Considerations

It’s not just a matter of promoting pilot projects or promising-sounding solutions for dynamic and engaging entrepreneurs — it also has to be about providing tangible benefits and opportunities for those taking the risks to show up in the first place. There is a tendency to focus on individual “rock star” examples and less on the more mundane work of addressing systemic, policy-oriented, and political change — and yet both are critical.
