# Civil Society

“Civil Society”, in the context of Tech4Good, refers to the wide array of community organizations, nonprofits and NGOs, unions, foundations, charities, faith-based organizations, and professional associates. These organizations have much to gain from the nuts-and-bolts of Tech4Good in the context of back-office technologies (productivity, HR, financing, coordinating) as well as organizing through expanding participation in civil society organizations through Internet technologies, mobile phones, and distributed networks.

## Potential Applications

- Use social media, video, and podcasts to raise awareness about and calls to action
- Monitor fraud, waste, and abuse through digital collection services
- Advanced algorithms to determine impact, refine investments, and target messaging

## Considerations

The organizations that have the most to benefit from Tech4Good digital transformations are often those least well-equipped with the resources, staffing, and expertise necessary to get started. With civil society organizations in general, there are often underlying systemic barriers preventing greater digital engagement that include challenging policy environments, political will, and more.
