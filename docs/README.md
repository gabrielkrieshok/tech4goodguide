This **Open Tech4Good** site is a set of guides and resources to help anyone who wants to make a positive social impact with technology's help.

Browse the Guide online here (optimized for mobile and as a [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/) as well), and contribute changes via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/gabrielkrieshok/open-tech4good/issues). I also maintain an [AirTable listing](basics/tech4good-airtable.html) of all the up-to-date resources as well.

## Dataset

If you are looking for the entire dataset of this site in an easily searchable and downloadable format, you can get it for $1 (pay what you are able and help support this side project ☕️) on [Gumroad](https://gabrielkrieshok.gumroad.com/l/tech4goodresources). Below is a preview of the Agriculture & Environment section of the resource table.

Finally, if you want even more, I [wrote a book](https://www.amazon.com/Gabriel-Krieshok/e/B07RTRKY9V/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1) which incorporates many of these resources, as well as additional history, context, and how-tos for using Tech4Good resources. [Check it out](https://tech4goodguide.org/).
